# dedupe_js

Currently, this project is for me to teach myself javascript by reimplementing [dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe). 
I learned Python, largely, by implementing dedupe, so I have hope this will be a good strategy.

Perhaps this will get to a point of maturity that it may be useful to others.
